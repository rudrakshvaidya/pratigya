    <h1>Happy 19th Birthday, my love 💌</h1>
    
    <p>I wish I could be there with you, to see you smile in person, to give you the tightest hug, and to see you get all shy and embarrassed from my cheesy romantic line. But for now, this message is carrying everything I’m feeling across the distance.</p>
    
    <p>You have this calm softness, like a lotus blooming. Every little thing about you, from your oddly cute love for bhindi & capsicum to the way you light up when talking about something you love, feels like home to me, even if home is currently hundreds of kilometers away.</p>
    
    <p>And let’s not forget those legendary size 5 feet. How those tiny shoes carry around such a strong, cute, intelligent, and endlessly lovable soul is honestly beyond me. You probably need to register them as emotional weapons!</p>
    
    <p>Being in a long-distance relationship isn’t always easy. Aese inne moments hote h that I miss you so much it physically hurts. But the truth is, I’d rather love you from a distance than be close to anyone else. Every call, every text, every silly reel we share, and every "I miss you" means something. They’re pieces of a love we’re building slowly and beautifully, and mai iske alawa i want nothing else.</p>
    
    <p>I’m so proud of the woman you’re becoming. Aaj meri silly girl turned 19. Same age as me for a few months, so don’t get too excited ml 😝🙏. Even if I’m not beside you physically, I’m with you in every other way that matters.</p>
    
    <p class="final-regards">I love you. More than I can put into this message. More than distance can measure.</p>
    
    <p class="final-regards">Happy Birthday Pratigya, my adorable little baby 🌸</p>

    <div class="signature">
      <p>Yours,</p>
